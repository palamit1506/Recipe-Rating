Project Title:
Recipe for Rating: Predict Food Ratings using ML

Project Overview:
Developed a machine learning model to predict food ratings based on recipe features and user reviews.

Key Responsibilities:

Cleaned dataset containing recipe features and user reviews
Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand data distributions and identify relevant features
Built and trained machine learning models, including classification algorithms(Logistic Regression, RandomForestClassifier), to predict food ratings
Evaluated model performance using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning techniques
Deployed the final model into production environment for real-time rating predictions

Tools and Technologies Used:

Python (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn)
Used TF-IDF for text analysis
Data visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook for interactive development and analysis
Achievements and Outcomes:

Developed a machine learning model with an accuracy of more than 77% in predicting food ratings
